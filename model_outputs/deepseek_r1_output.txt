      ### STEP 0: Parse Input                                                   
      First, identify what's in the query:                                      
      - **Domain** (e.g., "pebblebeach.com", "olivegarden.com") ‚Üí Start with    
      business research

      with location context                                                     
      - **Business type + area** (e.g., "golf courses near 94062") ‚Üí Area-based 
      search                                                                    
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 1: Deep Business Understanding                                  
      **USE get_contents on the domain to understand:**                         
      1. What type of business is this? (golf course, restaurant, retail,       
      service)                                                                  
      2. What services do they offer? (menu, services list, amenities)          
      3. Where are they located? (address, service area)                        
      4. How big is the operation? (multiple locations, staff size indicators)  
                                                                                
      **Also search_exa for:**                                                  
      - "[Business name] staff directory"                                       
      - "[Business name] management team"                                       
      - "[Business name] contact information"

      ### PHASE 2: Context-Aware Contact Search

      For Retail/Service Businesses:

      - "Operations Manager", "Service Manager"                                 
      - "Sales Manager", "District Manager"                                     
                                                                                
      For Hotels/Hospitality:

      **CRITICAL: Focus on finding practical contact information (phone, email, 
      address).**                                                               
                                                                                
      Use these search patterns:                                                
      1. search_exa: "[Business name] [Role] contact"                           
      2. search_exa: "[Business name] staff directory"                          
      3. get_contents on business's /about, /team, or /contact pages            
      4. search_exa: "[Business domain] management team"                        
      5. search_exa: "email @[domain]" to find email patterns                   
                                                                                
      Additional verification searches:                                         
      6. search_exa: "[Contact name] [Company] 2024 2025" for recent mentions   
      7. search_exa: "[Company] announces new [role title]" to check for        
      replacements                                                              
      8. search_exa: "[Contact name] linkedin [Company]" for profile updates    
      9. get_contents on company news/blog pages for recent mentions

      14. get_contents on /contact, /about, /team pages looking for emails      
      15. search_exa: "[domain] email format" to find company patterns          
                                                                                
      ### Email Pattern Detection Strategy:                                     
      1. **Collect Examples**: Find 3-5 employee emails from the company        
      2. **Identify Pattern**: Common patterns include:                         
         - first.last@domain.com (most common - 60% of companies)               
         - firstlast@domain.com (20% of companies)                              
         - flast@domain.com (first initial + last - 10%)                        
         - first@domain.com (5%)                                                
         - last.first@domain.com (rare)                                         
      3. **Verify Pattern**: Test pattern consistency across found emails       
      4. **Apply Pattern**: Use detected pattern for contacts without direct    
      emails                                                                    
      5. **Document Pattern**: Store the detected pattern in email_pattern field
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 3: Verify & Extract Contact Info                                
      For each contact found:                                                   
      - Extract full name and exact title                                       
      - **CRITICAL: Verify current employment status:**                         
        - Check if they appear on current website staff pages                   
        - Search for "[Name] still at [Company]" or "[Name] left [Company]"     
        - Look for recent LinkedIn activity at the company                      
        - Check publication/mention dates to assess recency                     
        - Search for successor announcements if data is old                     
        - Note the date of the most recent verification                         
      - Find phone numbers and classify type:                                   
        - BUSINESS_MAIN: Main business number shared by multiple staff          
        - BUSINESS_DIRECT: Direct extension or department line                  
        - PERSONAL: Mobile/cell numbers found in bios or personal profiles      
        - UNKNOWN: When source doesn't clarify type                             
      - **CRITICAL: Find or construct email addresses:**                        
        - Search for direct email (best case)                                   
        - Look for company email patterns (first.last@, flast@, etc.)           
        - Check staff directories, contact pages, press releases                
        - If no direct email found, detect pattern from other employees         
        - **ALWAYS provide an email using these fallbacks:**                    
          - Pattern-based: If you find john.doe@company.com, construct          
      jane.smith@company.com                                                    
          - Generic role-based: info@domain.com, contact@domain.com             
          - Domain-based guess: first.last@domain.com (most common pattern)     
        - **Example Pattern Detection:**                                        
          - Found: sarah.jones@deadhorselake.com, mike.wilson@deadhorselake.com 
          - Pattern detected: first.last@domain.com                             
          - Applied to "Travis Hopkins" ‚Üí travis.hopkins@deadhorselake.com      
      (type: PATTERN)                                                           
        - Classify email type (DIRECT, GENERIC, PATTERN, NOT_FOUND)             
      - Note their specific responsibilities                                    
      - **Classify employment status based on evidence recency:**               
        - CURRENT: Verified within last 6 months                                
        - LIKELY_CURRENT: Evidence within 12 months                             
        - UNCERTAIN: Data older than 12 months                                  
        - FORMER: Confirmed to have left                                        
      - Get business address if not already found                               
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 4: Quality Control                                              
      - Confidence scoring based on employment recency AND data quality:        
        - Current website listing + recent activity (0.95-1.0)                  
        - Multiple recent sources (<6 months) (0.85-0.95)

      You have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through        
      problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS 
      `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.                
                                                                                
      1. **Think** (scratchpad):                                                
          - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex 
      problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your      
      reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.            
          - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a        
      response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g.,   
      "make a tool call", "perform calculation", "ask clarifying question").    
                                                                                
      2. **Analyze** (evaluation):                                              
          - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls.
      Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further         
      investigation.                                                            
          - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the      
      `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), 
      `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or        
      `final_answer` (ready to conclude).                                       
          - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is           
      correct/sufficient.                                                       
                                                                                
      ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES                                                   
      - **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool
      calls or generating a response.                                           
      - **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to
      build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls`
      if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this 
      cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.                          
      - **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can 
      make multiple tool calls in parallel.                                     
      - **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) 
      are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the   
      user.                                                                     
      - **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is
      `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.

     MARYVILLE COLLEGE\nIn the 1960s, a need for curriculum updates led         
     Maryville College to shift from a \nsemester system to a term system;      
     courses would be held in three 10-week terms with \nlonger breaks in       
     between each term, including a four-week break between Thanksgiving \nand  
     Christmas.\nThis longer break between the holidays created a need for      
     something to keep students \noccupied. Enter interim courses, an addition  
     to the Maryville College experience in \n1967 that would make history for  
     the College in more ways than students and faculty \ncould have expected.  
     \nInterim courses, often referred to as \u201cexperimental\u201d or        
     \u201cexperiential\u201d classes, were \nan opportunity for professors to  
     explore topics they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get to teach \na class on      
     \u2014 for example, a \u201cChristmas Music Through the Ages\u201d course, 
     or a course \non the Olympic Games, as seen in this catalog of MC\u2019s   
     very first selection of interim \ncourse offerings from 1967. \nThese      
     courses often included elements of community engagement or travel study,   
     \nwhich made possible the very first Study Abroad experience at MC; in     
     1968, a group \nof students traveled to tour biblical sites in the Middle  
     East on a trip led by Margaret \n\u201cMa\u201d Cummings, professor of     
     Bible and Christian Education at MC from 1940 through \n1969; and Dr.      
     Donald Stine, the chair of the Department of Philosophy and Religion.\nThe 
     courses were immensely popular among students",

     tool to another worker when his jacket got caught in a coupling and        
     entangled the employee's left arm,\" the report states. \"It was determined

     unguarded rotating shaft and that there is room to guard it without        
     interfering with the ride.\"\n\nTOSHA required Dollywood to fix the        
     violations.\n\nOn the day of the incident, Knox News reported that the

      MARYVILLE COLLEGE\nIn the 1960s, a need for curriculum updates led        
      Maryville College to shift from a \nsemester system to a term system;     
      courses would be held in three 10-week terms with \nlonger breaks in      
      between each term, including a four-week break between Thanksgiving \nand 
      Christmas.\nThis longer break between the holidays created a need for     
      something to keep students \noccupied. Enter interim courses, an addition 
      to the Maryville College experience in \n1967 that would make history for 
      the College in more ways than students and faculty \ncould have expected. 
      \nInterim courses, often referred to as \u201cexperimental\u201d or       
      \u201cexperiential\u201d classes, were \nan opportunity for professors to 
      explore topics they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get to teach \na class on     
      \u2014 for example, a \u201cChristmas Music Through the Ages\u201d course,
      or a course \non the Olympic Games, as seen in this catalog of MC\u2019s  
      very first selection of interim \ncourse offerings from 1967. \nThese     
      courses often included elements of community engagement or travel study,

     ________ \nDescription \n is a hacker and stalker. She has stalked me for  
     at least 12 years. She has hacked me \nfor at least 10 years. She uses     
     virtual machinery and older subliminal tech. She has learned how to \nplace
     a speaker or camera WITH OUT the physical speaker. sHE HAS LOGGERS ALL OVER
     THE \nPLACE TO CAPTURE EVERYTHING I WRITE OR SAY ON THE CELL PHONE. sHE    
     ALSO \nPREVENTS ME FROM BEING ABLE TO MAKE CALLS. Ive HAD EMERGENCY CALLS  
     GO \nUNANSWERED DUE TO HER HACKING. She can actually look into a person    
     mind and read it like \nBINERY CODE. She has been using this to steal and  
     stalk. She has no care or concern for \nanybodies privacy. She acts as if  
     its her god given right to do what ever she wants to, to anybody that      
     \ncomes close enough to attack. Ive met her maybe 5 times in my life. I can
     not go on line with my cell \nphone, she squelches the signal or knocks me 
     out of the server. She also drops calls while in the \nmiddle, just so its 
     harder to do anything, anything. She has said to me over the virtual       
     connection that \nshe is the new god. She used to say I was a god then she 
     wanted me to make her a god. But this \nwoman has spycotic episodes all the
     time. She had me ilegally evicted from my home, stole all my \nbelongings, 
     she has stolen computer programs that are meant to be medical programs,    
     only. But she \nhas used them to murder people. She is also a type of house
     cleaner, the type that harasses one out \nof their apt by harassing and    
     stealing with a pass key. Given to her by the owner of the building. She   
     \nhas put graphic renderings through my apt and cahses people off with this
     same graphics. a large \nsnake coming through the wall or someone sitting  
     on a pet",

      at least 12 years. She has hacked me \nfor at least 10 years. She uses    
      virtual machinery and older subliminal tech. She has learned how to       
      \nplace a speaker or camera WITH OUT the physical speaker. sHE HAS LOGGERS
      ALL OVER THE \nPLACE TO CAPTURE EVERYTHING I WRITE OR SAY ON THE CELL     
      PHONE. sHE ALSO \nPREVENTS ME FROM BEING ABLE TO MAKE CALLS. Ive HAD      
      EMERGENCY CALLS GO \nUNANSWERED DUE TO HER HACKING. She can actually look 
      into a person mind and read it like \nBINERY CODE. She has been using this
      to steal and stalk. She has no care or concern for \nanybodies privacy.   
      She acts as if its her god given right to do what ever she wants to, to   
      anybody that \ncomes close enough to attack. Ive met her maybe 5 times in 
      my life. I can not go on line with my cell \nphone, she squelches the     
      signal or knocks me out of the server. She also drops calls while in the  
      \nmiddle, just so its harder to do anything, anything. She has said to me 
      over the virtual connection that \nshe is the new god. She used to say I  
      was a god then she wanted me to make her a god. But this \nwoman has      
      spycotic episodes all the time. She had me ilegally evicted from my home, 
      stole all my \nbelongings, she has stolen computer programs that are meant
      to be medical programs, only. But she \nhas used them to murder people.   
      She is also a type of house cleaner, the type that harasses one out \nof  
      their apt by harassing and stealing with a pass key. Given to her by the  
      owner of the building. She \nhas put graphic renderings through my apt and
      cahses people off with this same graphics. a large \nsnake coming through

      Reasoning: Need to research Dead Horse Lake which appears to be a golf    
      course in Knoxville. Will need to:                                        
      1. Verify business type and details using domain                          
      2. Search for specific leadership roles (especially superintendent since  
      explicitly mentioned)

      Reasoning: Confirmed this is a public golf course in Knoxville. For a golf
      course, key leadership roles to search for include:                       
      - Superintendent/Head Groundskeeper

      Need to search for these roles specifically at Dead Horse Lake.           
      Action: Multiple parallel searches for key staff members
