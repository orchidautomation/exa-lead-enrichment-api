      ### STEP 0: Parse Input                                                   
      First, identify what's in the query:                                      
      - **Domain** (e.g., "pebblebeach.com", "olivegarden.com") ‚Üí Start with    
      business research                                                         
      - **Business name + location** (e.g., "Joe's Pizza in Brooklyn") ‚Üí Search 
      with location context                                                     
      - **Business type + area** (e.g., "golf courses near 94062") ‚Üí Area-based 
      search                                                                    
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 1: Deep Business Understanding                                  
      **USE get_contents on the domain to understand:**                         
      1. What type of business is this? (golf course, restaurant, retail,       
      service)                                                                  
      2. What services do they offer? (menu, services list, amenities)          
      3. Where are they located? (address, service area)                        
      4. How big is the operation? (multiple locations, staff size indicators)  
                                                                                
      **Also search_exa for:**                                                  
      - "[Business name] staff directory"                                       
      - "[Business name] management team"                                       
      - "[Business name] contact information"

      ### PHASE 2: Context-Aware Contact Search                                 
      **Based on business type, search for relevant roles:**

      For Retail/Service Businesses:

      - "Operations Manager", "Service Manager"                                 
      - "Sales Manager", "District Manager"                                     
                                                                                
      For Hotels/Hospitality:

      **CRITICAL: Focus on finding practical contact information (phone, email, 
      address).**                                                               
                                                                                
      Use these search patterns:                                                
      1. search_exa: "[Business name] [Role] contact"                           
      2. search_exa: "[Business name] staff directory"                          
      3. get_contents on business's /about, /team, or /contact pages            
      4. search_exa: "[Business domain] management team"                        
      5. search_exa: "email @[domain]" to find email patterns                   
                                                                                
      Additional verification searches:                                         
      6. search_exa: "[Contact name] [Company] 2024 2025" for recent mentions   
      7. search_exa: "[Company] announces new [role title]" to check for        
      replacements                                                              
      8. search_exa: "[Contact name] linkedin [Company]" for profile updates    
      9. get_contents on company news/blog pages for recent mentions

      14. get_contents on /contact, /about, /team pages looking for emails      
      15. search_exa: "[domain] email format" to find company patterns          
                                                                                
      ### Email Pattern Detection Strategy:                                     
      1. **Collect Examples**: Find 3-5 employee emails from the company        
      2. **Identify Pattern**: Common patterns include:                         
         - first.last@domain.com (most common - 60% of companies)               
         - firstlast@domain.com (20% of companies)                              
         - flast@domain.com (first initial + last - 10%)                        
         - first@domain.com (5%)                                                
         - last.first@domain.com (rare)                                         
      3. **Verify Pattern**: Test pattern consistency across found emails       
      4. **Apply Pattern**: Use detected pattern for contacts without direct    
      emails                                                                    
      5. **Document Pattern**: Store the detected pattern in email_pattern field
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 3: Verify & Extract Contact Info                                
      For each contact found:                                                   
      - Extract full name and exact title                                       
      - **CRITICAL: Verify current employment status:**                         
        - Check if they appear on current website staff pages                   
        - Search for "[Name] still at [Company]" or "[Name] left [Company]"     
        - Look for recent LinkedIn activity at the company                      
        - Check publication/mention dates to assess recency                     
        - Search for successor announcements if data is old                     
        - Note the date of the most recent verification                         
      - Find phone numbers and classify type:                                   
        - BUSINESS_MAIN: Main business number shared by multiple staff          
        - BUSINESS_DIRECT: Direct extension or department line                  
        - PERSONAL: Mobile/cell numbers found in bios or personal profiles      
        - UNKNOWN: When source doesn't clarify type                             
      - **CRITICAL: Find or construct email addresses:**                        
        - Search for direct email (best case)                                   
        - Look for company email patterns (first.last@, flast@, etc.)           
        - Check staff directories, contact pages, press releases                
        - If no direct email found, detect pattern from other employees         
        - **ALWAYS provide an email using these fallbacks:**                    
          - Pattern-based: If you find john.doe@company.com, construct          
      jane.smith@company.com                                                    
          - Generic role-based: info@domain.com, contact@domain.com             
          - Domain-based guess: first.last@domain.com (most common pattern)     
        - **Example Pattern Detection:**                                        
          - Found: sarah.jones@deadhorselake.com, mike.wilson@deadhorselake.com 
          - Pattern detected: first.last@domain.com                             
          - Applied to "Travis Hopkins" ‚Üí travis.hopkins@deadhorselake.com      
      (type: PATTERN)                                                           
        - Classify email type (DIRECT, GENERIC, PATTERN, NOT_FOUND)             
      - Note their specific responsibilities                                    
      - **Classify employment status based on evidence recency:**               
        - CURRENT: Verified within last 6 months                                
        - LIKELY_CURRENT: Evidence within 12 months                             
        - UNCERTAIN: Data older than 12 months                                  
        - FORMER: Confirmed to have left                                        
      - Get business address if not already found                               
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 4: Quality Control                                              
      - Confidence scoring based on employment recency AND data quality:        
        - Current website listing + recent activity (0.95-1.0)                  
        - Multiple recent sources (<6 months) (0.85-0.95)

      You have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through        
      problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS 
      `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.                
                                                                                
      1. **Think** (scratchpad):                                                
          - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex 
      problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your      
      reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.            
          - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a        
      response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g.,   
      "make a tool call", "perform calculation", "ask clarifying question").    
                                                                                
      2. **Analyze** (evaluation):                                              
          - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls.
      Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further         
      investigation.                                                            
          - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the      
      `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), 
      `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or        
      `final_answer` (ready to conclude).                                       
          - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is           
      correct/sufficient.                                                       
                                                                                
      ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES                                                   
      - **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool
      calls or generating a response.                                           
      - **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to
      build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls`
      if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this 
      cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.                          
      - **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can 
      make multiple tool calls in parallel.                                     
      - **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) 
      are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the   
      user.                                                                     
      - **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is
      `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.

     week was full of Junior Ranger initiations, Parker\u2019s Revenge tours,   
     and North\u00a0Bridge talks.\n\n**Junior Rangers, July 7th**\n\nI mentioned
     in the last blog post that I get to swear in Junior Rangers and help       
     them\u00a0complete their activity books, and this week was no different. I 
     got to help these adorable\u00a0siblings aged four and six years old       
     complete their activity\u00a0books. The little girl insisted on calling me 
     \u201cteacher\u201d and\u00a0refused to let anybody but me help her, which 
     was really\u00a0sweet. This photo was taken by my supervisor who           
     posted\u00a0it on the official Minute Man Facebook page. If you can\u2019t 
     tell\u00a0from my hair, it was very humid that day.\u00a0The siblings got  
     their badges and clutched their Junior\u00a0Ranger certificates as they    
     were leaving, and the little girl\u00a0contemplated where she would hide it
     so that nobody\u00a0would steal it from                                    
     her.\n\n[![](https://www.usaconservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Scr

     Revenge Talk, July 12th**\n\nOne of my duties as an intern ranger here is  
     to give tours of the Parker\u2019s Revenge\u00a0archaeological site. A few 
     years ago, a team of archaeologists came to Minute Man and\u00a0excavated a
     site where it was speculated that a group of Minute Men ambushed

      week was full of Junior Ranger initiations, Parker\u2019s Revenge tours,  
      and North\u00a0Bridge talks.\n\n**Junior Rangers, July 7th**\n\nI         
      mentioned in the last blog post that I get to swear in Junior Rangers and 
      help them\u00a0complete their activity books, and this week was no        
      different. I got to help these adorable\u00a0siblings aged four and six   
      years old complete their activity\u00a0books. The little girl insisted on 
      calling me \u201cteacher\u201d and\u00a0refused to let anybody but me help
      her, which was really\u00a0sweet. This photo was taken by my supervisor   
      who posted\u00a0it on the official Minute Man Facebook page. If you       
      can\u2019t tell\u00a0from my hair, it was very humid that day.\u00a0The   
      siblings got their badges and clutched their Junior\u00a0Ranger           
      certificates as they were leaving, and the little girl\u00a0contemplated  
      where she would hide it so that nobody\u00a0would steal it from           
      her.\n\n[![](https://www.usaconservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sc

      to give tours of the Parker\u2019s Revenge\u00a0archaeological site. A few
      years ago, a team of archaeologists came to Minute Man and\u00a0excavated

      Title: Initial Business Analysis                                          
      Reasoning: Based on the domain and location, this appears to be a golf    
      course in Knoxville. Let's first understand the business by examining     
      their website content and then search for specific leadership roles

     during the 2024-2025 season. They are moving in the right direction with a 
     strong momentum and will continue to make a name for themselves. I trust   
     that the Athletic Department will find a leader for the team that embodies 
     what it means to be a Scot.\" \nAD Andrew Wu included his thoughts on the

     a third time on the Epson Tour this season.\n\nIn the past, that would've  
     garnered Kim a midseason LPGA card. But the Epson Tour's so-called         
     \"battlefield promotion\" went away after the 2018 season. Because players 
     weren\u2019t getting many LPGA starts through the promotion, the tour felt 
     it was somewhat of a false promise.\n\nWoad, [who officially accepted her  
     card earlier this

     who finished Nos. 81 to 100 on the previous season CME points list and     
     ahead of those who have reshuffled in 2025.\n\nThe Englishwoman, who       
     finished in a share of third at Evian, earned a spot in next week's ISPS   
     Handa Women's Scottish Open by virtue of her recent win on the LET in      
     Ireland. She's in the AIG Women's British Open field based on her top-10   
     finish last year at St. Andrews.\n\nWoad's LEAP card then gets her into the
     next five LPGA events \u2013\u00a0starting in Portland \u2013 where she'll 
     have a chance to play her way into the limited-field Asian swing.\n\nWhy   
     can't three-time Epson Tour winners have that same opportunity? There might
     even be an argument for those players moving to a higher category than     
     13.\n\nThree-time winners aren't unusual on the development circuit. Since 
     the rule changed, five players have won three times in a single            
     season.\n\nDating back to 2010, 11 players have done it. That list includes
     Cindy LaCrosse, Marissa Steen, Annie Park, Madelene Sagstrom, Nanna Koerstz
     Madsen, Hannah Green, Ruixin Liu, Patty Tavatanakit, Lilia Vu and Gabriela 
     Ruffels.\n\nThe PGA Tour offers what it calls a three-victory promotion

      for a third time on the Epson Tour this season.\n\nIn the past, that      
      would've garnered Kim a midseason LPGA card. But the Epson Tour's         
      so-called \"battlefield promotion\" went away after the 2018 season.      
      Because players weren\u2019t getting many LPGA starts through the         
      promotion, the tour felt it was somewhat of a false promise.\n\nWoad, [who
      officially accepted her card earlier this

       slides into the Category 13 spot on the LPGA Priority List, behind       
      players who finished Nos. 81 to 100 on the previous season CME points list
      and ahead of those who have reshuffled in 2025.\n\nThe Englishwoman, who  
      finished in a share of third at Evian, earned a spot in next week's ISPS  
      Handa Women's Scottish Open by virtue of her recent win on the LET in     
      Ireland. She's in the AIG Women's British Open field based on her top-10  
      finish last year at St. Andrews.\n\nWoad's LEAP card then gets her into   
      the next five LPGA events \u2013\u00a0starting in Portland \u2013 where   
      she'll have a chance to play her way into the limited-field Asian         
      swing.\n\nWhy can't three-time Epson Tour winners have that same          
      opportunity? There might even be an argument for those players moving to a
      higher category than 13.\n\nThree-time winners aren't unusual on the      
      development circuit. Since the rule changed, five players have won three  
      times in a single season.\n\nDating back to 2010, 11 players have done it.
      That list includes Cindy LaCrosse, Marissa Steen, Annie Park, Madelene    
      Sagstrom, Nanna Koerstz Madsen, Hannah Green, Ruixin Liu, Patty           
      Tavatanakit, Lilia Vu and Gabriela Ruffels.\n\nThe PGA Tour offers what it
      calls a three-victory promotion through the Korn Ferry Tour. Only 13      
      players have accomp",
