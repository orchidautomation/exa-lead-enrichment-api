      ### STEP 0: Parse Input                                                   
      First, identify what's in the query:                                      
      - **Domain** (e.g., "pebblebeach.com", "olivegarden.com") ‚Üí Start with    
      business research                                                         
      - **Business name + location** (e.g., "Joe's Pizza in Brooklyn") ‚Üí Search 
      with location context                                                     
      - **Business type + area** (e.g., "golf courses near 94062") ‚Üí Area-based 
      search                                                                    
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 1: Deep Business Understanding                                  
      **USE get_contents on the domain to understand:**                         
      1. What type of business is this? (golf course, restaurant, retail,       
      service)                                                                  
      2. What services do they offer? (menu, services list, amenities)          
      3. Where are they located? (address, service area)                        
      4. How big is the operation? (multiple locations, staff size indicators)  
                                                                                
      **Also search_exa for:**                                                  
      - "[Business name] staff directory"                                       
      - "[Business name] management team"                                       
      - "[Business name] contact information"

      ### PHASE 2: Context-Aware Contact Search                                 
      **Based on business type, search for relevant roles:**

      For Retail/Service Businesses:

      - "Operations Manager", "Service Manager"                                 
      - "Sales Manager", "District Manager"                                     
                                                                                
      For Hotels/Hospitality:

      **CRITICAL: Focus on finding practical contact information (phone, email, 
      address).**                                                               
                                                                                
      Use these search patterns:                                                
      1. search_exa: "[Business name] [Role] contact"                           
      2. search_exa: "[Business name] staff directory"                          
      3. get_contents on business's /about, /team, or /contact pages            
      4. search_exa: "[Business domain] management team"                        
      5. search_exa: "email @[domain]" to find email patterns                   
                                                                                
      Additional verification searches:                                         
      6. search_exa: "[Contact name] [Company] 2024 2025" for recent mentions   
      7. search_exa: "[Company] announces new [role title]" to check for        
      replacements                                                              
      8. search_exa: "[Contact name] linkedin [Company]" for profile updates    
      9. get_contents on company news/blog pages for recent mentions

      14. get_contents on /contact, /about, /team pages looking for emails      
      15. search_exa: "[domain] email format" to find company patterns          
                                                                                
      ### Email Pattern Detection Strategy:                                     
      1. **Collect Examples**: Find 3-5 employee emails from the company        
      2. **Identify Pattern**: Common patterns include:                         
         - first.last@domain.com (most common - 60% of companies)               
         - firstlast@domain.com (20% of companies)                              
         - flast@domain.com (first initial + last - 10%)                        
         - first@domain.com (5%)                                                
         - last.first@domain.com (rare)                                         
      3. **Verify Pattern**: Test pattern consistency across found emails       
      4. **Apply Pattern**: Use detected pattern for contacts without direct    
      emails                                                                    
      5. **Document Pattern**: Store the detected pattern in email_pattern field
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 3: Verify & Extract Contact Info                                
      For each contact found:                                                   
      - Extract full name and exact title                                       
      - **CRITICAL: Verify current employment status:**                         
        - Check if they appear on current website staff pages                   
        - Search for "[Name] still at [Company]" or "[Name] left [Company]"     
        - Look for recent LinkedIn activity at the company                      
        - Check publication/mention dates to assess recency                     
        - Search for successor announcements if data is old                     
        - Note the date of the most recent verification                         
      - Find phone numbers and classify type:                                   
        - BUSINESS_MAIN: Main business number shared by multiple staff          
        - BUSINESS_DIRECT: Direct extension or department line                  
        - PERSONAL: Mobile/cell numbers found in bios or personal profiles      
        - UNKNOWN: When source doesn't clarify type                             
      - **CRITICAL: Find or construct email addresses:**                        
        - Search for direct email (best case)                                   
        - Look for company email patterns (first.last@, flast@, etc.)           
        - Check staff directories, contact pages, press releases                
        - If no direct email found, detect pattern from other employees         
        - **ALWAYS provide an email using these fallbacks:**                    
          - Pattern-based: If you find john.doe@company.com, construct          
      jane.smith@company.com                                                    
          - Generic role-based: info@domain.com, contact@domain.com             
          - Domain-based guess: first.last@domain.com (most common pattern)     
        - **Example Pattern Detection:**                                        
          - Found: sarah.jones@deadhorselake.com, mike.wilson@deadhorselake.com 
          - Pattern detected: first.last@domain.com                             
          - Applied to "Travis Hopkins" ‚Üí travis.hopkins@deadhorselake.com      
      (type: PATTERN)                                                           
        - Classify email type (DIRECT, GENERIC, PATTERN, NOT_FOUND)             
      - Note their specific responsibilities                                    
      - **Classify employment status based on evidence recency:**               
        - CURRENT: Verified within last 6 months                                
        - LIKELY_CURRENT: Evidence within 12 months                             
        - UNCERTAIN: Data older than 12 months                                  
        - FORMER: Confirmed to have left                                        
      - Get business address if not already found                               
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 4: Quality Control                                              
      - Confidence scoring based on employment recency AND data quality:        
        - Current website listing + recent activity (0.95-1.0)                  
        - Multiple recent sources (<6 months) (0.85-0.95)

      You have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through        
      problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS 
      `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.                
                                                                                
      1. **Think** (scratchpad):                                                
          - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex 
      problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your      
      reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.            
          - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a        
      response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g.,   
      "make a tool call", "perform calculation", "ask clarifying question").    
                                                                                
      2. **Analyze** (evaluation):                                              
          - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls.
      Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further         
      investigation.                                                            
          - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the      
      `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), 
      `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or        
      `final_answer` (ready to conclude).                                       
          - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is           
      correct/sufficient.                                                       
                                                                                
      ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES                                                   
      - **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool
      calls or generating a response.                                           
      - **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to
      build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls`
      if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this 
      cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.                          
      - **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can 
      make multiple tool calls in parallel.                                     
      - **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) 
      are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the   
      user.                                                                     
      - **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is
      `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.

     MARYVILLE COLLEGE\nIn the 1960s, a need for curriculum updates led         
     Maryville College to shift from a \nsemester system to a term system;      
     courses would be held in three 10-week terms with \nlonger breaks in       
     between each term, including a four-week break between Thanksgiving \nand  
     Christmas.\nThis longer break between the holidays created a need for      
     something to keep students \noccupied. Enter interim courses, an addition  
     to the Maryville College experience in \n1967 that would make history for  
     the College in more ways than students and faculty \ncould have expected.  
     \nInterim courses, often referred to as \u201cexperimental\u201d or        
     \u201cexperiential\u201d classes, were \nan opportunity for professors to  
     explore topics they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get to teach \na class on      
     \u2014 for example, a \u201cChristmas Music Through the Ages\u201d course, 
     or a course \non the Olympic Games, as seen in this catalog of MC\u2019s   
     very first selection of interim \ncourse offerings from 1967. \nThese      
     courses often included elements of community engagement or travel study,   
     \nwhich made possible the very first Study Abroad experience at MC; in     
     1968, a group \nof students traveled to tour biblical sites in the Middle  
     East on a trip led by Margaret \n\u201cMa\u201d Cummings, professor of     
     Bible and Christian Education at MC from 1940 through \n1969; and Dr.      
     Donald Stine, the chair of the Department of Philosophy and Religion.\nThe 
     courses were immensely popular among students",

     almost 5,000 acres master-planned with 120 10-acre ranch homesites and     
     1,100 acres devoted to golf. There will be one 18-hole course, a 12-hole   
     par-3 course, 10 member cabins (four- and eight-bedroom floorplans), a     
     2.5-acre lighted putting green, a 365-degree driving range, a short-game   
     area, a 38-acre lake, and a performance center with a putting lab and      
     indoor/outdoor hitting bays. **Nelly Korda** inquired about membership     
     before the groundbreaking. And conversations have begun for the course,    
     which measures 7,700 yards and features both Stadium and Lazer Zoysia, to  
     host a professional event. _\u201cThis is one of the great opportunities to

      MARYVILLE COLLEGE\nIn the 1960s, a need for curriculum updates led        
      Maryville College to shift from a \nsemester system to a term system;     
      courses would be held in three 10-week terms with \nlonger breaks in      
      between each term, including a four-week break between Thanksgiving \nand 
      Christmas.\nThis longer break between the holidays created a need for     
      something to keep students \noccupied. Enter interim courses, an addition 
      to the Maryville College experience in \n1967 that would make history for 
      the College in more ways than students and faculty \ncould have expected. 
      \nInterim courses, often referred to as \u201cexperimental\u201d or       
      \u201cexperiential\u201d classes, were \nan opportunity for professors to 
      explore topics they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get to teach \na class on     
      \u2014 for example, a \u201cChristmas Music Through the Ages\u201d course,
      or a course \non the Olympic Games, as seen in this catalog of MC\u2019s  
      very first selection of interim \ncourse offerings from 1967. \nThese     
      courses often included elements of community engagement or travel study,  
      \nwhich made possible the very first Study Abroad experience at MC; in    
      1968, a group \nof students traveled to tour biblical sites in the Middle 
      East on a trip led by Margaret \n\u201cMa\u201d Cummings, professor of    
      Bible and Christian Education at MC from 1940 through \n1969; and Dr.     
      Donald Stine, the chair of the Department of Philosophy and Religion.\nThe
      courses were immensely popular among students",

      almost 5,000 acres master-planned with 120 10-acre ranch homesites and    
      1,100 acres devoted to golf. There will be one 18-hole course, a 12-hole  
      par-3 course, 10 member cabins (four- and eight-bedroom floorplans), a    
      2.5-acre lighted putting green, a 365-degree driving range, a short-game  
      area, a 38-acre lake, and a performance center with a putting lab and     
      indoor/outdoor hitting bays. **Nelly Korda** inquired about membership    
      before the groundbreaking. And conversations have begun for the course,   
      which measures 7,700 yards and features both Stadium and Lazer Zoysia, to 
      host a professional event. _\u201cThis is one of the great opportunities  
      to return to the area of my youth and build a spectacular golf course that
      will probably be a big part of my legacy,\u201d_ Azinger says."

     Golf Course\nDead Horse Lake Golf Course located just off of I-40/75 has   
     been a staple in the West Knoxville/Cedar Bluff area since 1973. Joe and   
     his brother Pete Parker decided to build the golf course upon encouragement
     from their father Bill Parker. They started construction in 1971 on what   
     was their family farm with the help of local golf course business owners   
     and a \u201cHow To\u201d book written by the USGA. Dead Horse Lake has been
     the host of the Men\u2019s Knoxville Amateur tournament as well has many   
     High School and Junior golf events. Over the past 20 years Dead Horse Lake 
     Golf Course has made many improvements to its facilities by adding a       
     Driving Range, Chipping area and Restaurant/Bar and continues to look for  
     ways to improve each year.\n# How Dead Horse Lake Golf Course Got Its

     the brothers referred to a story that dated back to 1792 from a local      
     history book. Legend has it that an explorer who traveled through the area 
     on horseback, got his horse stuck in quicksand while traveling through the 
     property. That swampy area (near the infamous Hole #3) swallowed the horse 
     filling the sinkhole and over several years formed what is now known as    
     Dead Horse Lake. In 1973 the course opened for play and #3 has been the    
     most discussed hole ever since. Hole #3 only 365 yards from the back tees  
     and 320 yards from the middle tees, allows golfers 2 options: take your    
     chance and carry the lake at least 260 yards from the tee box or cross the 
     lake twice by taking two 160 yard shots to reach the green. Choose wisely  
     because if you don\u2019t your golf ba",

      Golf Course\nDead Horse Lake Golf Course located just off of I-40/75 has  
      been a staple in the West Knoxville/Cedar Bluff area since 1973. Joe and  
      his brother Pete Parker decided to build the golf course upon             
      encouragement from their father Bill Parker. They started construction in 
      1971 on what was their family farm with the help of local golf course     
      business owners and a \u201cHow To\u201d book written by the USGA. Dead   
      Horse Lake has been the host of the Men\u2019s Knoxville Amateur          
      tournament as well has many High School and Junior golf events. Over the  
      past 20 years Dead Horse Lake Golf Course has made many improvements to   
      its facilities by adding a Driving Range, Chipping area and Restaurant/Bar
      and continues to look for ways to improve each year.\n# How Dead Horse    
      Lake Golf Course Got Its Name\nWhen Joe and Pete were debating about the  
      name of the golf course, the brothers referred to a story that dated back 
      to 1792 from a local history book. Legend has it that an explorer who     
      traveled through the area on horseback, got his horse stuck in quicksand  
      while traveling through the property. That swampy area (near the infamous 
      Hole #3) swallowed the horse filling the sinkhole and over several years  
      formed what is now known as Dead Horse Lake. In 1973 the course opened for
      play and #3 has been the most discussed hole ever since. Hole #3 only 365 
      yards from the back tees and 320 yards from the middle tees, allows       
      golfers 2 options: take your chance and carry the lake at least 260 yards 
      from the tee box or cross the lake twice by taking two 160 yard shots to  
      reach the green. Choose wisely because if you don\u2019t your golf ba",

      Reasoning: Need to research Dead Horse Lake Golf Course in Knoxville. This
      appears to be a golf course business, so we'll focus on golf course       
      management roles including superintendent, general manager, and other     
      leadership positions. Let's start by understanding the business and then  
      find key contacts.

      Title: Business Research                                                  
      Reasoning: We've confirmed this is a public golf course in Knoxville. Now 
      let's search for key management positions including superintendent,       
      general manager, and golf pro. We'll need to use multiple search patterns 
      to find current staff.

      Title: Initial Research Analysis                                          
      Reasoning: While we have basic business information, we need to search    
      more specifically for current leadership positions and contact details.   
      The course is family-owned which suggests stable management. Let's search 
      specifically for superintendent and management positions.                 
      Action: None

     lifestyle community founded in 1970 and located about an hour from         
     Knoxville, Tenn., Fairfield Glade now has 9,100 residents, 5,800 homes,    
     five golf courses, and 18,000+ members who live all over the country. Aside
     from golf, there are 11 lakes, three swimming pools, an indoor racquet     
     center, pickleball courts, and 20-some miles of walking trails. One thing  
     that stood out as an area of need was the quality food service at one of   
     the property\u2019s most high-profile food and beverage venues, the        
     Stonehenge Grille.\n\nIn March of 2023, Bobby Jones Links (BJL) was hired  
     to manage food and beverage operations at Fairfield Glade, aiming to       
     improve financial performance and member engagement at Stonehenge Grille

      residents, 5,800 homes, five golf courses, and 18,000+ members who live   
      all over the country. Aside from golf, there are 11 lakes, three swimming 
      pools, an indoor racquet center, pickleball courts, and 20-some miles of  
      walking trails. One thing that stood out as an area of need was the       
      quality food service at one of the property\u2019s most high-profile food 
      and beverage venues, the Stonehenge Grille.\n\nIn March of 2023, Bobby

      Reasoning: Need to research Dead Horse Lake Golf Course in Knoxville. This
      appears to be a golf course business, so we'll focus on golf course       
      management roles including superintendent, general manager, and other     
      leadership positions. Let's start by understanding the business and then  
      find key contacts.

      Reasoning: We've confirmed this is a public golf course in Knoxville. Now 
      let's search for key management positions including superintendent,       
      general manager, and golf pro. We'll need to use multiple search patterns

      Reasoning: While we have basic business information, we need to search    
      more specifically for current leadership positions and contact details.   
      The course is family-owned which suggests stable management. Let's search 
      specifically for superintendent and management positions.
