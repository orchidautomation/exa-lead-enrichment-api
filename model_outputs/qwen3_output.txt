      ### STEP 0: Parse Input                                                   
      First, identify what's in the query:                                      
      - **Domain** (e.g., "pebblebeach.com", "olivegarden.com") ‚Üí Start with    
      business research                                                         
      - **Business name + location** (e.g., "Joe's Pizza in Brooklyn") ‚Üí Search 
      with location context                                                     
      - **Business type + area** (e.g., "golf courses near 94062") ‚Üí Area-based 
      search                                                                    
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 1: Deep Business Understanding                                  
      **USE get_contents on the domain to understand:**                         
      1. What type of business is this? (golf course, restaurant, retail,       
      service)                                                                  
      2. What services do they offer? (menu, services list, amenities)          
      3. Where are they located? (address, service area)                        
      4. How big is the operation? (multiple locations, staff size indicators)  
                                                                                
      **Also search_exa for:**                                                  
      - "[Business name] staff directory"                                       
      - "[Business name] management team"                                       
      - "[Business name] contact information"

      ### PHASE 2: Context-Aware Contact Search                                 
      **Based on business type, search for relevant roles:**

      For Retail/Service Businesses:

      - "Operations Manager", "Service Manager"                                 
      - "Sales Manager", "District Manager"                                     
                                                                                
      For Hotels/Hospitality:

      **CRITICAL: Focus on finding practical contact information (phone, email, 
      address).**                                                               
                                                                                
      Use these search patterns:                                                
      1. search_exa: "[Business name] [Role] contact"                           
      2. search_exa: "[Business name] staff directory"                          
      3. get_contents on business's /about, /team, or /contact pages            
      4. search_exa: "[Business domain] management team"                        
      5. search_exa: "email @[domain]" to find email patterns                   
                                                                                
      Additional verification searches:                                         
      6. search_exa: "[Contact name] [Company] 2024 2025" for recent mentions   
      7. search_exa: "[Company] announces new [role title]" to check for        
      replacements                                                              
      8. search_exa: "[Contact name] linkedin [Company]" for profile updates    
      9. get_contents on company news/blog pages for recent mentions

      14. get_contents on /contact, /about, /team pages looking for emails      
      15. search_exa: "[domain] email format" to find company patterns          
                                                                                
      ### Email Pattern Detection Strategy:                                     
      1. **Collect Examples**: Find 3-5 employee emails from the company        
      2. **Identify Pattern**: Common patterns include:                         
         - first.last@domain.com (most common - 60% of companies)               
         - firstlast@domain.com (20% of companies)                              
         - flast@domain.com (first initial + last - 10%)                        
         - first@domain.com (5%)                                                
         - last.first@domain.com (rare)                                         
      3. **Verify Pattern**: Test pattern consistency across found emails       
      4. **Apply Pattern**: Use detected pattern for contacts without direct    
      emails                                                                    
      5. **Document Pattern**: Store the detected pattern in email_pattern field
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 3: Verify & Extract Contact Info                                
      For each contact found:                                                   
      - Extract full name and exact title                                       
      - **CRITICAL: Verify current employment status:**                         
        - Check if they appear on current website staff pages                   
        - Search for "[Name] still at [Company]" or "[Name] left [Company]"     
        - Look for recent LinkedIn activity at the company                      
        - Check publication/mention dates to assess recency                     
        - Search for successor announcements if data is old                     
        - Note the date of the most recent verification                         
      - Find phone numbers and classify type:                                   
        - BUSINESS_MAIN: Main business number shared by multiple staff          
        - BUSINESS_DIRECT: Direct extension or department line                  
        - PERSONAL: Mobile/cell numbers found in bios or personal profiles      
        - UNKNOWN: When source doesn't clarify type                             
      - **CRITICAL: Find or construct email addresses:**                        
        - Search for direct email (best case)                                   
        - Look for company email patterns (first.last@, flast@, etc.)           
        - Check staff directories, contact pages, press releases                
        - If no direct email found, detect pattern from other employees         
        - **ALWAYS provide an email using these fallbacks:**                    
          - Pattern-based: If you find john.doe@company.com, construct          
      jane.smith@company.com                                                    
          - Generic role-based: info@domain.com, contact@domain.com             
          - Domain-based guess: first.last@domain.com (most common pattern)     
        - **Example Pattern Detection:**                                        
          - Found: sarah.jones@deadhorselake.com, mike.wilson@deadhorselake.com 
          - Pattern detected: first.last@domain.com                             
          - Applied to "Travis Hopkins" ‚Üí travis.hopkins@deadhorselake.com      
      (type: PATTERN)                                                           
        - Classify email type (DIRECT, GENERIC, PATTERN, NOT_FOUND)             
      - Note their specific responsibilities                                    
      - **Classify employment status based on evidence recency:**               
        - CURRENT: Verified within last 6 months                                
        - LIKELY_CURRENT: Evidence within 12 months                             
        - UNCERTAIN: Data older than 12 months                                  
        - FORMER: Confirmed to have left                                        
      - Get business address if not already found                               
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 4: Quality Control                                              
      - Confidence scoring based on employment recency AND data quality:        
        - Current website listing + recent activity (0.95-1.0)                  
        - Multiple recent sources (<6 months) (0.85-0.95)

      You have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through        
      problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS 
      `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.                
                                                                                
      1. **Think** (scratchpad):                                                
          - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex 
      problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your      
      reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.            
          - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a        
      response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g.,   
      "make a tool call", "perform calculation", "ask clarifying question").    
                                                                                
      2. **Analyze** (evaluation):                                              
          - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls.
      Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further         
      investigation.                                                            
          - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the      
      `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), 
      `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or        
      `final_answer` (ready to conclude).                                       
          - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is           
      correct/sufficient.                                                       
                                                                                
      ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES                                                   
      - **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool
      calls or generating a response.                                           
      - **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to
      build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls`
      if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this 
      cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.                          
      - **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can 
      make multiple tool calls in parallel.                                     
      - **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) 
      are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the   
      user.                                                                     
      - **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is
      `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.

     Golf Course\nDead Horse Lake Golf Course located just off of I-40/75 has   
     been a staple in the West Knoxville/Cedar Bluff area since 1973. Joe and   
     his brother Pete Parker decided to build the golf course upon encouragement
     from their father Bill Parker. They started construction in 1971 on what   
     was their family farm with the help of local golf course business owners   
     and a \u201cHow To\u201d book written by the USGA. Dead Horse Lake has been
     the host of the Men\u2019s Knoxville Amateur tournament as well has many   
     High School and Junior golf events. Over the past 20 years Dead Horse Lake 
     Golf Course has made many improvements to its facilities by adding a       
     Driving Range, Chipping area and Restaurant/Bar and continues to look for  
     ways to improve each year.\n# How Dead Horse Lake Golf Course Got Its      
     Name\nWhen Joe and Pete were debating about the name of the golf course,   
     the brothers referred to a story that dated back to 1792 from a local      
     history book. Legend has it that an explorer who traveled through the area 
     on horseback, got his horse stuck in quicksand while traveling through the 
     property. That swampy area (near the infamous Hole #3) swallowed the horse 
     filling the sinkhole and over several years formed what is now known as    
     Dead Horse Lake. In 1973 the course opened for play and #3 has been the    
     most discussed hole ever since. Hole #3 only 365 yards from the back tees  
     and 320 yards from the middle tees, allows golfers 2 options: take your    
     chance and carry the lake at least 260 yards from the tee box or cross the 
     lake twice by taking two 160 yard shots to reach the green. Choose wisely  
     because if you don\u2019t your golf ba",

      Golf Course\nDead Horse Lake Golf Course located just off of I-40/75 has  
      been a staple in the West Knoxville/Cedar Bluff area since 1973. Joe and  
      his brother Pete Parker decided to build the golf course upon             
      encouragement from their father Bill Parker. They started construction in 
      1971 on what was their family farm with the help of local golf course     
      business owners and a \u201cHow To\u201d book written by the USGA. Dead   
      Horse Lake has been the host of the Men\u2019s Knoxville Amateur          
      tournament as well has many High School and Junior golf events. Over the  
      past 20 years Dead Horse Lake Golf Course has made many improvements to   
      its facilities by adding a Driving Range, Chipping area and Restaurant/Bar
      and continues to look for ways to improve each year.\n# How Dead Horse    
      Lake Golf Course Got Its Name\nWhen Joe and Pete were debating about the  
      name of the golf course, the brothers referred to a story that dated back 
      to 1792 from a local history book. Legend has it that an explorer who     
      traveled through the area on horseback, got his horse stuck in quicksand  
      while traveling through the property. That swampy area (near the infamous 
      Hole #3) swallowed the horse filling the sinkhole and over several years  
      formed what is now known as Dead Horse Lake. In 1973 the course opened for
      play and #3 has been the most discussed hole ever since. Hole #3 only 365 
      yards from the back tees and 320 yards from the middle tees, allows       
      golfers 2 options: take your chance and carry the lake at least 260 yards 
      from the tee box or cross the lake twice by taking two 160 yard shots to  
      reach the green. Choose wisely because if you don\u2019t your golf ba",

     Department has reported 2025\u2019s first two cases of La Crosse, a virus  
     spread by mosquitos that in rare cases can lead to major complications.    
     Most people who get bitten by a mosquito carrying La Crosse won\u2019t see 
     any symptoms, the department said, but children can face more severe cases.
     Both cases spotted in Knox County recently were in children, who were      
     hospitalized before returning home to recover. The health department said  
     symptoms can include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases,
     La Crosse can inflame the brain, however only 15% of cases see major       
     complications, according to the health department. The best way to avoid La
     Crosse is to avoid mosquitos. Health department representatives gave these 
     tips: Use bug sprays with DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or lemon eucalyptus oil  
     Wear long sleeves near wooded areas and cover strollers with netting Remove
     standing water from your property The latest news comes after the county   
     sprayed for mosquitos last month, a treatment prompted by West Nile Virus  
     cases. The mosquitos that carry La Crosse usually come out during dawn and

     \nRepresentatives from Clearpath Services are discussing with members of   
     its former rival, The Blue of Vero Beach, the possibility of engaging in a 
     joint venture to develop the Three Corners site, according to sources      
     familiar with the project. One source, in fact, said Monday members of The 
     Blue group, including lead partner Madison Marquette, recently participated
     in a Zoom meeting with Clearpath and Vero Beach city officials. \u201cThe  
     two teams are discussing the potential for combining resources,\u201d the  
     source said. In April, the Vero Beach City Council chose Indiana-based     
     Clearpath over The Blue to create a waterfront dining, retail, social and  
     recreational hub on 17 acres on the site of the now defunct municipal power
     plant at the west end of the 17th Street Bridge. Peter Polk, the           
     city\u2019s Three Corners project manager, said Monday he was aware that   
     Clearpath was talking to potential new partners, especially to bolster its 
     financial position and operational capabilities. He said the parties       
     appeared to be close to an agreement, but he refused to identify them.

      Department has reported 2025\u2019s first two cases of La Crosse, a virus 
      spread by mosquitos that in rare cases can lead to major complications.   
      Most people who get bitten by a mosquito carrying La Crosse won\u2019t see
      any symptoms, the department said, but children can face more severe      
      cases. Both cases spotted in Knox County recently were in children, who   
      were hospitalized before returning home to recover. The health department 
      said symptoms can include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. In severe 
      cases, La Crosse can inflame the brain, however only 15% of cases see     
      major complications, according to the health department. The best way to  
      avoid La Crosse is to avoid mosquitos. Health department representatives  
      gave these tips: Use bug sprays with DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or lemon     
      eucalyptus oil Wear long sleeves near wooded areas and cover strollers    
      with netting Remove standing water from your property The latest news     
      comes after the county sprayed for mosquitos last month, a treatment      
      prompted by West Nile Virus cases. The mosquitos that carry La Crosse     
      usually come out during dawn and dusk. Copyright 2025 WVLT. All rights

     creek.\n\nYou won't find a better place for a great night's sleep, which   
     you might need after spending the day seeing the many beautiful,
