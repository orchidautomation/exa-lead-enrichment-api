      ### STEP 0: Parse Input                                                   
      First, identify what's in the query:                                      
      - **Domain** (e.g., "pebblebeach.com", "olivegarden.com") ‚Üí Start with    
      business research

      with location context                                                     
      - **Business type + area** (e.g., "golf courses near 94062") ‚Üí Area-based 
      search                                                                    
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 1: Deep Business Understanding                                  
      **USE get_contents on the domain to understand:**                         
      1. What type of business is this? (golf course, restaurant, retail,       
      service)                                                                  
      2. What services do they offer? (menu, services list, amenities)          
      3. Where are they located? (address, service area)                        
      4. How big is the operation? (multiple locations, staff size indicators)  
                                                                                
      **Also search_exa for:**                                                  
      - "[Business name] staff directory"                                       
      - "[Business name] management team"                                       
      - "[Business name] contact information"

      ### PHASE 2: Context-Aware Contact Search

      For Retail/Service Businesses:

      - "Operations Manager", "Service Manager"                                 
      - "Sales Manager", "District Manager"                                     
                                                                                
      For Hotels/Hospitality:

      **CRITICAL: Focus on finding practical contact information (phone, email, 
      address).**                                                               
                                                                                
      Use these search patterns:                                                
      1. search_exa: "[Business name] [Role] contact"                           
      2. search_exa: "[Business name] staff directory"                          
      3. get_contents on business's /about, /team, or /contact pages            
      4. search_exa: "[Business domain] management team"                        
      5. search_exa: "email @[domain]" to find email patterns                   
                                                                                
      Additional verification searches:                                         
      6. search_exa: "[Contact name] [Company] 2024 2025" for recent mentions   
      7. search_exa: "[Company] announces new [role title]" to check for        
      replacements                                                              
      8. search_exa: "[Contact name] linkedin [Company]" for profile updates    
      9. get_contents on company news/blog pages for recent mentions

      14. get_contents on /contact, /about, /team pages looking for emails      
      15. search_exa: "[domain] email format" to find company patterns          
                                                                                
      ### Email Pattern Detection Strategy:                                     
      1. **Collect Examples**: Find 3-5 employee emails from the company        
      2. **Identify Pattern**: Common patterns include:                         
         - first.last@domain.com (most common - 60% of companies)               
         - firstlast@domain.com (20% of companies)                              
         - flast@domain.com (first initial + last - 10%)                        
         - first@domain.com (5%)                                                
         - last.first@domain.com (rare)                                         
      3. **Verify Pattern**: Test pattern consistency across found emails       
      4. **Apply Pattern**: Use detected pattern for contacts without direct    
      emails                                                                    
      5. **Document Pattern**: Store the detected pattern in email_pattern field
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 3: Verify & Extract Contact Info                                
      For each contact found:                                                   
      - Extract full name and exact title                                       
      - **CRITICAL: Verify current employment status:**                         
        - Check if they appear on current website staff pages                   
        - Search for "[Name] still at [Company]" or "[Name] left [Company]"     
        - Look for recent LinkedIn activity at the company                      
        - Check publication/mention dates to assess recency                     
        - Search for successor announcements if data is old                     
        - Note the date of the most recent verification                         
      - Find phone numbers and classify type:                                   
        - BUSINESS_MAIN: Main business number shared by multiple staff          
        - BUSINESS_DIRECT: Direct extension or department line                  
        - PERSONAL: Mobile/cell numbers found in bios or personal profiles      
        - UNKNOWN: When source doesn't clarify type                             
      - **CRITICAL: Find or construct email addresses:**                        
        - Search for direct email (best case)                                   
        - Look for company email patterns (first.last@, flast@, etc.)           
        - Check staff directories, contact pages, press releases                
        - If no direct email found, detect pattern from other employees         
        - **ALWAYS provide an email using these fallbacks:**                    
          - Pattern-based: If you find john.doe@company.com, construct          
      jane.smith@company.com                                                    
          - Generic role-based: info@domain.com, contact@domain.com             
          - Domain-based guess: first.last@domain.com (most common pattern)     
        - **Example Pattern Detection:**                                        
          - Found: sarah.jones@deadhorselake.com, mike.wilson@deadhorselake.com 
          - Pattern detected: first.last@domain.com                             
          - Applied to "Travis Hopkins" ‚Üí travis.hopkins@deadhorselake.com      
      (type: PATTERN)                                                           
        - Classify email type (DIRECT, GENERIC, PATTERN, NOT_FOUND)             
      - Note their specific responsibilities                                    
      - **Classify employment status based on evidence recency:**               
        - CURRENT: Verified within last 6 months                                
        - LIKELY_CURRENT: Evidence within 12 months                             
        - UNCERTAIN: Data older than 12 months                                  
        - FORMER: Confirmed to have left                                        
      - Get business address if not already found                               
                                                                                
      ### PHASE 4: Quality Control                                              
      - Confidence scoring based on employment recency AND data quality:        
        - Current website listing + recent activity (0.95-1.0)                  
        - Multiple recent sources (<6 months) (0.85-0.95)

      You have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through        
      problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS 
      `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.                
                                                                                
      1. **Think** (scratchpad):                                                
          - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex 
      problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your      
      reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.            
          - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a        
      response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g.,   
      "make a tool call", "perform calculation", "ask clarifying question").    
                                                                                
      2. **Analyze** (evaluation):                                              
          - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls.
      Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further         
      investigation.                                                            
          - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the      
      `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), 
      `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or        
      `final_answer` (ready to conclude).                                       
          - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is           
      correct/sufficient.                                                       
                                                                                
      ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES                                                   
      - **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool
      calls or generating a response.                                           
      - **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to
      build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls`
      if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this 
      cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.                          
      - **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can 
      make multiple tool calls in parallel.                                     
      - **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) 
      are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the   
      user.                                                                     
      - **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is
      `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.

     newly elected President of the East Tennessee Golf Course Superintendents  
     Association. My name is Travis Hopkins and I have been the Golf Course     
     Superintendent at Dead Horse Lake Golf Course in Knoxville for the last six
     years. I am excited for this opportunity serve our East Tennessee area and 
     collaborate with other golf course professionals.\nAs we begin the spring  
     season, it is looking to be a promising and busy year in the golf course   
     industry. After a year of isolation, people are ready to get out and about.
     I have a feeling that it will be another booming year for the golf course  
     industry. One of the challenges that comes along with everyone ready to get
     out is being able to accommodate the amount of play and being able to      
     maintain the golf course properly. I am very thankful for our thriving     
     business and hope it continues to hand us these challenges, which are      
     reassuring in today\u2019s economy.\nAdvertisement\nI am looking forward to
     the speakers that we have lined up for our upcoming meetings this year. I  
     also encourage everyone to come and bring any crew members to be a part of

      the newly elected President of the East Tennessee Golf Course             
      Superintendents Association. My name is Travis Hopkins and I have been the
      Golf Course Superintendent at Dead Horse Lake Golf Course in Knoxville for
      the last six years. I am excited for this opportunity serve our East      
      Tennessee area and collaborate with other golf course professionals.\nAs  
      we begin the spring season, it is looking to be a promising and busy year 
      in the golf course industry. After a year of isolation, people are ready  
      to get out and about. I have a feeling that it will be another booming    
      year for the golf course industry. One of the challenges that comes along 
      with everyone ready to get out is being able to accommodate the amount of 
      play and being able to maintain the golf course properly. I am very       
      thankful for our thriving business and hope it continues to hand us these 
      challenges, which are reassuring in today\u2019s                          
      economy.\nAdvertisement\nI am looking forward to the speakers that we have
      lined up for our upcoming meetings this year. I also encourage everyone to
      come and bring any crew members to be a part of these learning            
      opportunities. Hope everyone has a great year!\n### Travis Hopkins\nGolf

      Title: Initial Search Strategy Planning                                   
      Reasoning: The query is asking for leadership contacts at Dead Horse Lake,
      which appears to be a golf course in Knoxville. Since it specifically     
      mentions "superintendent," this suggests it's definitely a golf facility. 
      Let me:                                                                   
      1. First understand the business by examining their website               
      2. Look specifically for superintendent and management team               
      3. Search for specific contact information                                
      4. Verify current employment status                                       
      Action: Examine website content first to understand the business          
      Confidence: 0.9

      Title: Search for Management Team                                         
      Reasoning: Now that I've confirmed it's a public golf course in Knoxville,
      I'll search specifically for:                                             
      1. Golf course superintendent                                             
      2. General Manager/Director of Golf                                       
      3. Other key management staff                                             
      Let me use targeted searches with specific golf course role titles.       
      Action: Make multiple targeted searches for key staff members

     \n Travis Club Austin \n \n \n \n Work has started on the Travis Club      
     Austin, a 1,500-acre master-planned community west of Austin on Lake Travis
     featuring a Beau Welling -designed golf course. The Travis Club is the     
     latest among a collection of recent projects from Beau Welling Design that 
     includes the new Fields Ranch West at Omni PGA Frisco and significant      
     renovations at Atlanta Country Club and Ocean Forest Golf Club. The        
     championship course at the Travis Club is scheduled to debut in late 2025  
     along with the accompanying practice facility, comfort stations and initial
     social outlet, the Golf House. Based in Greenville, South Carolina, the BWD
     team has assisted in the creation and development of more than 120 courses 
     around the world. Senior designer and vice president Scott Benson is       
     assisting Welling on the par-72 layout. \u201cOur team and I are excited to
     have broken ground at the Travis Club and to start working on bringing the 
     design to life,\u201d Welling said. \u201cTravis Club is going to be a     
     truly special addition to the Texas golf scene and anchor to the           
     outstanding Travis Club community. Our goals with the design were to honor 
     the stunning Hill Country landscape along Lake Travis and create a course  
     that people would enjoy playing time and time again, regardless of their   
     skill level.\u201d Welling leads a team of experts who bring technical,    
     creative and innovative expertise to his firm\u2019s work. Bluejack        
     National, Escondido and Dallas National are among the other Texas courses  
     Welling has worked on. \u201cFrom the first tee to the final putt, this    
     18-hole golf wonder will never cease to amaze, whether it's green-ribboned 
     fairways winding past oaks, low-cut green surrounds, or the abundance of   
     panoramic vistas and technicolor sunsets,\u201d Travis Club vice president 
     of development Jimmy Terry said. \u201cWelling and his team have walked the
     land countless times with a mind toward creating a golf experience that    
     takes advantage of the dr",

      with everyone ready to get out is being able to accommodate the amount of 
      play and being able to maintain the golf course properly. I am very       
      thankful for our thriving business and hope it continues to hand us these 
      challenges, which are reassuring in today\u2019s

      Club Austin, a 1,500-acre master-planned community west of Austin on Lake 
      Travis featuring a Beau Welling -designed golf course. The Travis Club is 
      the latest among a collection of recent projects from Beau Welling Design 
      that includes the new Fields Ranch West at Omni PGA Frisco and significant
      renovations at Atlanta Country Club and Ocean Forest Golf Club. The       
      championship course at the Travis Club is scheduled to debut in late 2025 
      along with the accompanying practice facility, comfort stations and       
      initial social outlet, the Golf House. Based in Greenville, South         
      Carolina, the BWD team has assisted in the creation and development of    
      more than 120 courses around the world. Senior designer and vice president
      Scott Benson is assisting Welling on the par-72 layout. \u201cOur team and
      I are excited to have broken ground at the Travis Club and to start

      Club is going to be a truly special addition to the Texas golf scene and  
      anchor to the outstanding Travis Club community. Our goals with the design
      were to honor the stunning Hill Country landscape along Lake Travis and   
      create a course that people would enjoy playing time and time again,      
      regardless of their skill level.\u201d Welling leads a team of experts who
      bring technical, creative and innovative expertise to his firm\u2019s     
      work. Bluejack National, Escondido and Dallas National are among the other
      Texas courses Welling has worked on. \u201cFrom the first tee to the final
      putt, this 18-hole golf wonder will never cease to amaze, whether it's    
      green-ribboned fairways winding past oaks, low-cut green surrounds, or the
      abundance of panoramic vistas and technicolor sunsets,\u201d Travis Club  
      vice president of development Jimmy Terry said. \u201cWelling and his team
      have walked the land countless times with a mind toward creating a golf

      Title: Initial Search Strategy Planning                                   
      Reasoning: The query is asking for leadership contacts at Dead Horse Lake,
      which appears to be a golf course in Knoxville. Since it specifically     
      mentions "superintendent," this suggests it's definitely a golf facility. 
      Let me:                                                                   
      1. First understand the business by examining their website               
      2. Look specifically for superintendent and management team               
      3. Search for specific contact information                                
      4. Verify current employment status                                       
      Action: Examine website content first to understand the business          
      Confidence: 0.9                                                           
                                                                                
      Step 2:                                                                   
      Title: Search for Management Team                                         
      Reasoning: Now that I've confirmed it's a public golf course in Knoxville,
      I'll search specifically for:                                             
      1. Golf course superintendent                                             
      2. General Manager/Director of Golf                                       
      3. Other key management staff                                             
      Let me use targeted searches with specific golf course role titles.       
      Action: Make multiple targeted searches for key staff members             
      Confidence: 0.85                                                          
                                                                                
      Step 3:                                                                   
      Title: Found Key Contact - Verify Current Status                          
      Reasoning: I've found Travis Hopkins as the Golf Course Superintendent.   
      The article from 2021 confirms his role, but I need to:                   
      1. Verify if he's still in the position                                   
      2. Find his contact information                                           
      3. Look for additional management team members                            
      4. Search for email patterns at deadhorselake.com                         
      Action: Search for recent mentions and contact information
